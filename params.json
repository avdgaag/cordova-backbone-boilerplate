{"name":"Cordova Backbone.js Boilerplate","tagline":"A project template for Cordova applications with Backbone.js","body":"# Cordova Backbone boilerplate\r\n\r\nThis is a project template for Cordova projects with Backbone. It has a simple\r\nbuild system with Grunt and uses Backbone, jQuery, underscore, Sass, Mocha and\r\nChai.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nClone the repository and install required dependencies:\r\n\r\n    % npm install\r\n\r\nTo use the Grunt CLI you need to install it globally:\r\n\r\n    % npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n\r\nNow you can serve the project on a local development server for browser\r\ndevelopment:\r\n\r\n    % grunt serve\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\nYou can use these Grunt tasks:\r\n\r\n* `serve`: build the project, watch for changes and serve on a local web server\r\n  for local browser development. Live Reload is enabled.\r\n* `build`: prepare all files in `./www`, including concatenated javascripts,\r\n  compiled Sass stylesheets, optimised images and any static HTML files. Only\r\n  changed files are updated. Before all this, runs `jshint`.\r\n* rebuild: same as `build` but runs `clean` first.\r\n* `clean`: removes the entire output directory.\r\n* `jshint`: check for linting errors in javascript source files.\r\n\r\nNPM provides the following tasks:\r\n\r\n* `test`: run the Mocha test suite (from `./test`)\r\n\r\nFinally, you can use any Cordova commands to run or emulate the project. See\r\n`cordova -h` for more information.\r\n","google":"UA-20357800-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
